# Heart-Stroke-Analysis-Dashboard

### **Project Overview:**  
1. **Developed an Interactive Stroke Risk Dashboard** – Created a **Power BI dashboard** to analyze and visualize stroke risk factors using demographic and health-related data.  
2. **Implemented Key Risk Metrics** – Calculated and displayed essential metrics such as **count of patients (35K), percentage of at-risk individuals (36.82%), and average risk percentage (44.48%)** for better decision-making.  
3. **Explored Symptoms and Risk Factors** – Used **treemaps, bar charts, and pie charts** to identify common symptoms (e.g., **shortness of breath, high blood pressure, fatigue**) and their distribution among patients.  
4. **Analyzed Stroke Risk Trends Across Demographics** – Examined **age-based stroke risk trends**, gender distribution, and impact of **irregular heartbeat & high blood pressure** on stroke risk.  

### **Key Insights:**  
- **Higher Stroke Risk in Older Age Groups:** Stroke risk percentage is significantly **higher in individuals aged 71+** compared to younger age groups.  
- **Gender-Based Risk Distribution:** More **males (7.1K) than females (5.8K)** are at risk of stroke.  
- **Common Symptoms of At-Risk Patients:** The most frequent symptoms include **shortness of breath, high blood pressure, and fatigue weakness**, which could be critical early indicators of stroke.  
- **Impact of Risk Categories:** Patients in the **high-risk category make up the majority of cases (35K)**, highlighting the importance of early intervention.
